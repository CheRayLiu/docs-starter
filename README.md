# Starter repo for Fern Docs

Quick start 

Step 1: Fork this repo 
Step 2: Clone your fork 
Step 3: Generate "Hello World" docs
Step 4: Customize your docs
Step 5: [Optional] Setup a custom domain on our [Starter plan](https://buildwithfern.com/pricing) for `docs.yourdomain.com`. 

## Step 3: Generating "Hello World" docs

Install the Fern CLI by running:

```bash
$ npm install -g fern-api
```

Now that the CLI is installed, generate docs:

```bash
$ fern generate --docs
```

You'll be asked to login. Enter `y` which will walk you through connecting your GitHub account.



When the docs are generated, Fern automatically publishes them to the domain configured in `docs.yml`. After successfully generating docs, you'll see:

```

```

## Step 4: Customize your docs 

You can configure:
- the logo
- the favicon
- the domain name
